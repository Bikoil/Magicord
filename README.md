# Magicord
*An Open source discord bot with multiple features written in JS*




***



# What is Magicord?
- Magicord used to be a bot primarily hosted on [Botghost](https://botghost.com) but since it was unreliable and had limitations, I decided to move it to [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org), everything is still being moved so not everything has been added here.
# Features
- Modern reaction roles
- Setup applications as an alternative to google forms
- Safety system against raids
- Configuration to your liking 
- Edit the bot's code to your liking! (Need js knowledge)

__NOTE THAT MOST OF THESE FEATURES HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET__

*Original dev team that made this: !!Cords!!, this dev team is not public yet*
